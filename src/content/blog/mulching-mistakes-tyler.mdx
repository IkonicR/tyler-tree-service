Drive around any new subdivision in Tyler, and you will see it:
A beautiful new Live Oak planted in the front yard, piled high with a mountain of red dyed mulch right up against the trunk.

Landscapers call it "The Mulch Volcano."
Arborists call it **"The Kiss of Death."**

## Why Volcanos Kill Trees
Tree bark is designed to protect the tree from air and sun. It is NOT designed to be wet constantly.
When you pile mulch against the trunk:
1.  **Bark Rot:** The moisture trapped against the bark causes it to rot. This breaks the tree's seal.
2.  **Insect Entry:** Insects and rodents love the soft, moist shelter. They burrow into the mulch and eat the bark, girdling the tree.
3.  **Girdling Roots:** The tree gets confused. It starts growing roots *into* the mulch pile instead of the ground. These roots wrap around the trunk and strangle the tree as they grow (Stem Girdling Roots).

## The Correct Way: The "Donut"
Mulch is actually great for trees—if you do it right. It retains moisture and suppresses weeds.
Think **Donut**, not Volcano.

1.  **Width:** Spread the mulch out as wide as possible (to the drip line is best).
2.  **Depth:** 2 to 4 inches deep. No more.
3.  **The Gap:** Pull the mulch back **3-6 inches from the trunk**. You should be able to see the "Root Flare" (where the trunk widens into the ground).

## Dyed Mulch vs. Native Mulch
*   **Red/Black Dyed Mulch:** This is usually shredded pallets (trash wood) sprayed with dye. It often contains nails and chemicals. It doesn't add nutrients to the soil.
*   **Native Hardwood Mulch:** This is shredded trees (bark and wood). As it breaks down, it mimics the forest floor, adding organic matter and feeding the tree.
*   **Pine Straw:** Excellent for acid-loving trees like Pines, Azaleas, and Dogwoods.

## How to Fix a Volcano
If your landscaper built a volcano:
1.  Go out there with a rake or your hands.
2.  Pull the mulch back until you see the trunk flare.
3.  Spread it out to the sides.

**It takes 5 minutes and saves the tree's life.**

**Need Mulch?**
We produce high-quality native mulch from the trees we remove. It’s the best food for Tyler soil.
