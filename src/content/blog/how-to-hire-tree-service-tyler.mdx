In Tyler, trees are big business. And unfortunately, that attracts a lot of unqualified operators. After every major storm, we see "storm chasers" flood into Smith County—guys with a pickup truck and a chainsaw but no insurance, no training, and no accountability.

Hiring the wrong tree service can cost you thousands. If an uninsured worker drops a limb on your roof or gets injured on your property, **you** could be liable.

Here is your checklist for hiring a reputable tree service in Tyler, Whitehouse, and Lindale.

## 1. Proof of Insurance (Non-Negotiable)

This is the #1 rule. **Never** let anyone climb a tree on your property without seeing a Certificate of Insurance (COI).

*   **General Liability:** Covers damage to your home (e.g., if they drop a tree on your fence or roof).
*   **Workers' Compensation:** Covers the crew if they get hurt. Without this, an injured worker could sue *you* for their medical bills.

**The Tyler Tree Service Promise:** We carry full GL and Workers' Comp. We are happy to email you a copy of our certificate before we start.

## 2. Specialized Equipment vs. "Spikes"

Ask how they plan to prune your trees.

*   **The Warning Sign:** If they say they will use "spikes" (climbing gaffs) to climb a tree you want to *keep* (like for trimming), **fire them immediately**. Spikes puncture the cambium layer and introduce disease. Spikes should *only* be used for removals.
*   **The Pro Way:** We use ropes, harnesses, and bucket trucks to access the canopy without wounding the tree.

## 3. Written Estimates

A verbal price is meaningless. Unscrupulous contractors will quote a low price, start the job, and then demand more money to finish "because it was harder than they thought."

Always get a **detailed written estimate** that includes:
*   Exact scope of work (which trees, what gets cut).
*   Cleanup details (is haul-away included? Stump grinding?).
*   Total price.

## 4. Local References

Are they from here? Or did they just drive in from out of state because they heard there was a storm?

Local companies like **Tyler Tree Service** have a reputation to maintain. We live here. We are your neighbors in Smith County. We aren't going to disappear tomorrow.

## 5. Safety Gear (PPE)

Look at the crew. Are they wearing helmets? Chainsaw chaps? Eye protection? Or are they in t-shirts and tennis shoes?

Lack of PPE is a sign of a lack of professionalism. Tree work is the one of the most dangerous jobs in the U.S. A crew that doesn't care about their own safety won't care about your property's safety.
