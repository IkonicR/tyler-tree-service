Tyler is known for its roses, and roses love water. But many of our trees—especially Post Oaks and Pines—hate having "wet feet."

In East Texas, we often get massive rainfall in March and April. When you combine 10 inches of rain with our dense **Clay Soil**, you get a bathtub effect. The water sits, the oxygen is pushed out, and the roots suffocate.

This leads to **Root Rot** (often caused by the fungus *Phytophthora*).

## The Symptoms (Often Confused with Drought)
This is tricky. A tree with root rot looks exactly like a tree with drought stress.
*   **Wilting Leaves:** The roots are rotting, so they can't pump water. The leaves wilt because they are thirsty, even though the tree is sitting in mud.
*   **Yellowing (Chlorosis):** The leaves turn yellow while the veins stay green.
*   **Canopy Dieback:** The top of the tree starts to die first.

## The "Perc Test"
Dig a hole 12 inches deep near the tree. Fill it with water.
*   **Good Drainage:** Empty in 1-2 hours.
*   **Bad Drainage:** Water still there after 24 hours.
If the water sits, your tree is drowning.

## Which Trees Die First?
1.  **Post Oaks:** They are extremely intolerant of wet soil.
2.  **Shortleaf Pines:** They prefer sandy, well-drained ridges.
3.  **Fruit Trees:** Peaches and Plums will die quickly in standing water.

## How to Save Them
If the tree is already rotting (soft, mushy roots), it’s likely too late. But you can save the others:

### 1. Improve Drainage
*   **French Drains:** We can install drainage systems to move water away from the root zone.
*   **Aeration:** Punching holes in the soil to let oxygen down to the roots.

### 2. Stop Watering
Turn off your sprinklers. If it rained 2 inches this week, your trees do NOT need more water.

### 3. Mulch Correctly
Remove thick plastic weed barriers. They trap moisture and fungus. Use natural hardwood mulch instead.

## Replacement Strategy
If you lose a tree to root rot, **do not plant the same species** in the same hole.
*   **Plant Water-Lovers:** Consider a Bald Cypress, Willow Oak, or River Birch. These trees love the wet Tyler springs.

**Suspect Root Rot?**
We can inspect the root collar (the base of the tree) and tell you if it's rot or drought.
