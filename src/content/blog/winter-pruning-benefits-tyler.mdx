Most homeowners in Tyler think about their trees in two seasons: Spring (when everything grows) and Summer (when storms hit).

But if you ask an Arborist, the best time to touch your trees is right in the middle of winter: **December through February.**

Here is why "Dormant Pruning" is the secret to a healthier, safer landscape in East Texas.

## 1. Disease Prevention (Oak Wilt)
This is the big one. **Oak Wilt** is spread by beetles that are attracted to the smell of fresh sap.
*   **In Spring/Summer:** The sap is flowing, and the beetles are active. One cut can kill a tree.
*   **In Winter:** The beetles are dead or dormant due to the cold. You can prune your Live Oaks and Red Oaks with almost zero risk of infection.

## 2. Structure Visibility
In summer, your trees are covered in leaves. It’s hard to see the "bones" of the tree.
*   **In Winter:** With the leaves gone (on deciduous trees), we can clearly see:
    *   Crossing branches that rub together.
    *   Weak "V-crotches" that will split in a storm.
    *   Deadwood that needs to come out.
*   **Result:** We can make more precise, structural cuts that improve the tree's shape for years to come.

## 3. Less Stress on the Tree
Pruning is surgery. It hurts the tree.
When you cut a branch in July, the tree is already stressed from the Texas heat and is trying to keep its leaves alive.
When you cut in January, the tree is "asleep" (dormant). It doesn't lose sap/energy. When it wakes up in spring, the wounds have already started to heal, and it can push all its energy into new growth.

## 4. Cheaper Rates?
Sometimes! The tree industry slows down in winter. You can often get on the schedule faster and might even find better pricing than during the peak "Spring Rush."

## What Should You Prune Now?
*   **Crepe Myrtles:** Stop "murdering" them! We do corrective pruning in winter to fix the butchery of previous years.
*   **Oaks:** This is the ONLY safe time to touch them.
*   **Fruit Trees:** Essential for better fruit production next year.

**Don't wait until the spring storms.**
Get your trees structural and safe while they sleep.
