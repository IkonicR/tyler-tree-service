In East Texas, we have two main storm seasons: the spring thunderstorms (hail, tornadoes, high winds) and the winter ice storms.

Every year, after the clouds clear, we drive around Tyler and see the *exact same types of trees* lying on roofs, fences, and power lines. It’s not random. Some trees are biologically weaker than others.

If you have one of these 3 offenders in your yard, you need to be extra vigilant.

## 1. The Bradford Pear (The #1 Offender)

This is the most notorious tree in suburbia. Planted everywhere in the 90s for its white flowers, the **Bradford Pear** is structurally doomed from the start.

*   **The Flaw:** They grow with "co-dominant stems"—meaning all the heavy branches grow out of a single point on the trunk, like a bouquet. This creates a weak "V-crotch."
*   **The Result:** As the tree gets heavy, gravity wins. In high winds or ice, the tree literally splits in half. We call it "peeling the banana."
*   **Advice:** If you have a large Bradford Pear near your driveway or house, remove it before it removes itself.

## 2. The Silver Maple

Silver Maples grow incredibly fast. That's why developers love them. But fast growth means **soft, brittle wood**.

*   **The Flaw:** Their wood is not dense enough to support their massive, sprawling limbs during an ice storm. They are also prone to internal rot that you can't see from the ground.
*   **The Result:** They tend to drop massive limbs (widowmakers) rather than falling over completely.
*   **Advice:** Aggressive weight reduction (trimming) every 2-3 years is mandatory to keep these safe.

## 3. The Hackberry

You probably didn't plant this one. Birds planted it. Hackberries are "weed trees" that grow anywhere.

*   **The Flaw:** They have shallow root systems and wood that rots easily. They are also magnets for mistletoe, which adds winter weight to the branches.
*   **The Result:** They are highly susceptible to uprooting in saturated soil (windthrow).
*   **Advice:** Don't let them grow large near your home. They offer little value and high risk.

## What About Pines and Oaks?

*   **Pines:** Generally strong, but can snap if compromised by beetles.
*   **Oaks:** Our native Post Oaks and Live Oaks are the warriors of the storm. They rarely fail unless they are diseased (Hypoxylon) or have had their roots cut.

## Preparation Checklist

Don't wait for the tornado siren.

1.  **Look Up:** Do you see dead branches hanging? (We call these "hangers").
2.  **Look Down:** Are there mushrooms at the base? (Root rot).
3.  **Look Inside:** Can you see daylight through the canopy? If not, the tree might be too dense (a "sail") and needs thinning to let wind pass through.

**Peace of Mind is Cheap.**
An emergency removal at 2 AM on a Sunday costs 3x more than a scheduled removal on a Tuesday.
