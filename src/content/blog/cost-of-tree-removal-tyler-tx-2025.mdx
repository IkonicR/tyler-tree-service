"How much will it cost to take this tree down?"

This is the first question we get when the phone rings. And we get it—tree work isn't cheap, and homeowners in **Tyler** need to budget for it.

While we can't give you an exact dollar amount without seeing the tree (every tree is unique), we can give you the **local averages for Smith County** so you know what to expect.

## The "East Texas" Variables
Pricing in Tyler is different than Dallas or Houston. Here is why:
1.  **Height:** We have massive **Loblolly Pines** that can reach 100+ feet. Height = Risk = Cost.
2.  **Access:** A tree in a pasture in **Whitehouse** is cheaper to remove than a tree squeezed between a pool and a fence in **The Woods**.
3.  **Equipment:** Do we need a crane? Can we get a bucket truck in? Or do we have to climb it manually?

## Average Price Ranges in Tyler (2025)

### 1. Small Trees (Up to 30 Feet)
*   **Typical Cost:** **$300 – $650**
*   **Examples:** Dogwoods, small Bradford Pears, young Pines.
*   **The Process:** Usually a quick "fell and removal." A crew can often do this in an hour.

### 2. Medium Trees (30 to 60 Feet)
*   **Typical Cost:** **$650 – $1,100**
*   **Examples:** Mature Bradford Pears, smaller Oaks, Elm trees.
*   **The Process:** This usually requires rigging (ropes) to lower branches safely so they don't damage the lawn.

### 3. Large Trees (60 to 80 Feet)
*   **Typical Cost:** **$1,100 – $2,000**
*   **Examples:** Mature Post Oaks, Water Oaks, standard Pines.
*   **The Process:** This is technical work. We need climbers or bucket trucks. There is significant debris to haul away.

### 4. The "Monster" Trees (80+ Feet or Hazardous)
*   **Typical Cost:** **$2,000 – $4,000+**
*   **Examples:** The massive Loblolly Pines towering over a two-story house. 100-year-old Oaks with **Hypoxylon Canker** that are unstable.
*   **The Process:** This often requires a **Crane Removal**. We lift the tree out piece by piece over your house. It is the safest method but requires heavy machinery and insurance.

## Extra Costs to Consider

### Stump Grinding
Removal generally gets the tree down to almost flush with the ground. **Stump grinding is a separate service.**
*   **Cost:** Usually **$3 – $6 per inch** of diameter.
*   **Average:** $150 – $400 per stump.
*   *Why do it?* Termites love old stumps. In East Texas, grinding is highly recommended to prevent termite colonies near your foundation.

### Debris Haul-Away
Our quotes **include** haul-away.
*   **Warning:** Some "guy with a truck" might quote you $500 less, but he will leave the wood on your curb. The City of Tyler **Solid Waste** will NOT pick up massive commercial tree logs. You will be stuck with it. Always ensure "Haul Away" is in the contract.

## How to Save Money on Tree Removal
1.  **Bundle Services:** Removing 3 trees at once is cheaper per tree than doing them one by one (the crew is already there).
2.  **Keep the Firewood:** If you have a fireplace (or a friend who does), ask us to leave the logs (cut to 18"). We save on disposal fees, and you get free heat.
3.  **Winter Work:** January and February are "slower" months for arborists. You can sometimes get a better rate when demand is lower.

## Get an Exact Price (No Surprises)
We don't believe in hidden fees. We come to your property, look at the access, assess the danger, and give you a **guaranteed written price**.
