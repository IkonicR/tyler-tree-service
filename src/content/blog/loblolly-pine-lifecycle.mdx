The **Loblolly Pine** (*Pinus taeda*) is the king of the East Texas forest. They grow fast, tall, and straight. They are the reason Tyler is so green year-round.

But unlike the majestic Live Oak, which can live for 300+ years, the Loblolly Pine lives life in the fast lane.

## The Timeline of a Tyler Pine

### 1. The Rocket Phase (0-20 Years)
Pines are sprinters. In good soil, a Loblolly can grow 2-3 feet per year.
*   **Care:** Keep them watered. Watch out for Tip Moths.
*   **Risk:** Low. They are flexible and bend in the wind.

### 2. The Prime (20-60 Years)
This is when the tree is majestic. It reaches 60-90 feet tall. The bark turns into thick, puzzle-piece plates.
*   **Care:** Monitor for beetles. Mulch the base.
*   **Risk:** Moderate. They are strong, but a direct lightning strike or ice storm can damage them.

### 3. The Decline (80-100 Years)
This is the maximum lifespan for most urban pines in Tyler.
*   **Signs of Old Age:**
    *   **Flat Top:** The tree stops growing up and the top becomes flat or "stag-headed" (dead branches at the peak).
    *   **Thinning Canopy:** You can see more sky through the needles.
    *   **Cone Overload:** Sometimes a dying pine produces a "stress crop" of hundreds of small cones in a last-ditch effort to reproduce.

## When Should You Remove It?
You don't have to cut a pine just because it's old. But you must assess the **Target**.
*   **In the Woods:** Let it die and fall. It becomes a home for woodpeckers and owls.
*   **Near Your House:** This is different.

A 90-foot dead pine is a 5-ton hammer waiting to fall. Once a pine dies, the wood rots incredibly fast (unlike oak). It can become unclimbable and dangerous to remove within 6 months.

## The "Proactive" Removal
We often recommend removing pines *before* they are fully dead, especially if they are leaning over a bedroom.
*   **Cheaper:** Removing a live, stable tree is safer and faster (cheaper) than removing a rotting, unstable one.
*   **Cleaner:** A live tree doesn't shatter when it hits the ground.

## Summary
Love your pines, but respect their limits. If your Loblolly is pushing 80 years old and towering over your roof, it might be time to consider a succession plan—planting a new tree now so it's ready when the giant falls.
