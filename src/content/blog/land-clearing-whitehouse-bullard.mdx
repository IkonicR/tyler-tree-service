The real estate market in **Whitehouse**, **Bullard**, and **Flint** is booming. We see it every day: families buying 1-5 acre wooded lots to build their dream homes.

But before you can pour the slab, you have to tame the jungle.

Land clearing in East Texas isn't just about bulldozing everything flat. It requires a strategy to save the *good* trees while removing the scrub. Here is how we approach lot clearing in Smith County.

## 1. The "Selective Clearing" Approach
In the old days, developers would "clear cut" the entire lot—remove every single tree. This is a mistake for two reasons:
1.  **Property Value:** Mature Oaks and Pines add thousands of dollars to your property value.
2.  **Heat:** A house with no shade in a Texas summer will have a massive electric bill.

**Our Strategy:** We walk the lot with you *first*. We mark the "Keepers" (usually majestic Post Oaks or straight Loblolly Pines) with orange tape. Then we clear everything else around them.

## 2. Handling the Underbrush (Yaupon & Greenbrier)
The thick undergrowth in East Texas is usually a mix of **Yaupon Holly**, **Greenbrier**, and **Poison Ivy**.
*   **Forestry Mulching:** For underbrush, we use a skid steer with a mulching head. This shreds the brush into the soil, creating a nutrient-rich layer.
*   **The Benefit:** No burn piles. No hauling costs. You get a "park-like" finish immediately.

## 3. Pine Tree Removal
Most undeveloped lots are crowded with skinny, competition-stressed Pine trees.
*   **Thinning:** We remove the "suppressed" trees (the small ones struggling for light) to allow the dominant trees to grow wider and stronger.
*   **Foundation Zone:** You typically need to clear trees within 20-30 feet of your future foundation to prevent root interference.

## 4. Dealing with Stumps
If you are building a house or driveway over the area, **stump grinding is not enough**.
*   **Excavation:** For the building pad, we must dig out the stumps completely (root ball and all). If you leave wood buried under a foundation, it will rot, causing the soil to collapse and your slab to crack.
*   **Pasture/Yard:** For the rest of the yard, we just grind the stumps to save money and soil structure.

## 5. Permits & Erosion Control
If you are clearing more than an acre, you might need a SWPPP (Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan) to prevent mud from running off into the county roads.
We handle the **Silt Fencing** and erosion control measures to keep you compliant with Smith County regulations.
