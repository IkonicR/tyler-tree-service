# Storm Damage? Stay Safe First.

Texas weather is unpredictable. When an ice storm or tornado hits Smith County, trees are often the first thing to break.

If a tree has fallen on your house, car, or driveway, **your safety is the only priority**. Do not attempt to move it yourself.

## 1. The "Red Zone" Checklist

Before you even step outside, check for these immediate dangers. If you see any of these, **call 911** or your utility provider immediately.

*   **Downed Power Lines:** Never assume a line is dead. Electricity can arc through wet branches.
*   **Gas Leaks:** If you smell rotten eggs or hear hissing, evacuate immediately.
*   **Structural Collapse:** If the tree has crushed a load-bearing wall, do not enter that part of the house.

> **CRITICAL WARNING:** Do not touch any tree branch that is touching a power line. Call **Oncor** (1-888-313-4747) immediately to cut the power first.

## 2. Document Everything

Once you are safe, and before we arrive to clear the debris, you need to document the scene for your insurance company.

**Take photos of:**
1.  The tree on the structure (from multiple angles).
2.  The broken point on the tree (where it snapped).
3.  Any damage to gutters, siding, or vehicles.
4.  The debris field in the yard.

*Tip: Do not cut up the tree until you have spoken to your adjuster, unless it is an immediate hazard to life.*

## 3. Who Should You Call?

You need a professional who can handle **Hazardous Removals**. Not every landscaper has the equipment to lift a 5,000 lb Pine off a roof without causing further damage.

**We specialize in:**
*   **Crane-Assisted Removal:** Lifting the tree *up* and away, rather than dragging it.
*   **Tarping:** We can install emergency tarps to prevent water damage while you wait for roof repairs.
*   **Insurance Coordination:** We provide the detailed invoices and photos your insurance company requires.

## 4. Can the Tree Be Saved?

Not every storm-damaged tree needs to be removed. However, **Pines are different from Oaks**. If a Pine tree's main leader is snapped, it typically cannot be "topped" or restored and must be removed to prevent future rot.

For Oaks and Hardwoods, if the trunk is intact and less than 30% of the canopy is lost, we might be able to perform **Restoration Pruning**.

We will assess:
*   **Cracks in the main stem.**
*   **Broken "leader" branches.**
*   **Root plate stability (is the ground lifting?).**

## Need Emergency Help?

We have crews on standby 24/7 for storm response in Tyler, Whitehouse, and Lindale.

[**Call our Emergency Line**](/contact) immediately. We prioritize trees on structures and blocked driveways.
