In the Piney Woods, the Southern Pine Beetle (and its cousins, the Ips Beetle and Turpentine Beetle) is the number one enemy of our beautiful Loblolly and Shortleaf Pines.

These tiny insects bore into the bark, tunnel through the cambium layer, and lay eggs. In doing so, they cut off the flow of water and nutrients, effectively strangling the tree from the inside out.

The question we hear most often is: **"Can I save my tree?"**

The answer depends entirely on *when* you catch it.

## The Warning Signs

### 1. Pitch Tubes (The "Popcorn")
This is the first sign. The tree tries to defend itself by pumping sap into the holes the beetles drill. This creates small, popcorn-sized clumps of white, yellow, or reddish resin on the bark.
*   **Good News:** If the tubes are white and soft, the tree might be winning the battle.
*   **Bad News:** If the tubes are dry and crumbly, the beetles have won.

### 2. Sawdust (Frass)
Look at the base of the tree or in spiderwebs on the bark. If you see fine dust that looks like sawdust, it's "frass"—the waste product of beetles chewing through your tree.

### 3. Fading Canopy
The needles start to turn from dark green to yellow-green, then to red/brown.
*   **Verdict:** Once the canopy is red, the tree is dead. The beetles have likely already moved on to your neighbor's trees.

## Is It Too Late?

### The "Save" Zone
If you only see a few pitch tubes on the lower trunk (usually Turpentine Beetles) and the canopy is still fully green, we *might* be able to help.
*   **Treatment:** Systemic insecticide injections or bark sprays can sometimes stop the infestation if it's in the very early stages.
*   **Care:** Deep watering is critical to help the tree produce enough sap to drown the beetles.

### The "Removal" Zone
If you see:
*   Pitch tubes going all the way up the trunk (indicating Ips or Southern Pine Beetle).
*   A fading or brown canopy.
*   Significant sawdust at the base.

**It is too late.** The tree cannot be saved. The priority now shifts to **Containment**.

## Why You Must Remove Infested Trees

Pine beetles use pheromones to call their friends. One infested tree acts as a beacon, attracting thousands more beetles to your property. If you leave a "beetle kill" tree standing, the infestation will spread to your healthy pines nearby.

**Standard Procedure:** We remove the infested tree and often recommend treating the surrounding healthy trees preventatively to create a barrier.

### Protect Your Pine Forest

If you have a stand of pines on your property in Tyler, vigilance is key. Walk your property once a month. Look for the popcorn.
