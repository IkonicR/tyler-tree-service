Living in **Tyler, TX** means living with storms. Between the spring hail storms and the occasional tornado warning in Smith County, trees take a beating.

When a massive Oak crashes down, the first question homeowners ask is: **"Will my insurance pay for this?"**

The answer is usually **Yes, BUT...** it depends entirely on where the tree landed and why it fell.

## Scenario A: The Tree Hit Your House (Covered)
If a healthy tree falls during a storm and damages a covered structure (your home, attached garage, and sometimes a fence), your homeowners insurance generally covers:
1.  **The repairs** to the structure (roof, siding, windows).
2.  **The removal** of the tree *off* the structure so repairs can be made.

**The Catch:** There is usually a cap on "debris removal." They might pay $1,000 to get the tree off the roof, but they might not pay to haul the wood away from the curb. You need to check your policy limits.

## Scenario B: The Tree Fell in the Yard (Not Covered)
This surprises many people.
If a 100ft Pine tree falls across your backyard but **misses your house** (and misses the fence/shed/driveway), insurance usually pays **$0**.

Why? Insurance covers *damage to property*. If the tree just hit the dirt, they consider that a landscaping issue, not a property damage claim. You are responsible for the cleanup cost.

> **Exceptions:** Some premium policies have "debris removal" endorsements that might pay $500 or so to help clean up the mess, even if it didn't hit the house. Check with your agent.

## Scenario C: The "Negligence" Loophole (Denied!)
This is the most important rule for East Texas homeowners.

Insurance covers "Acts of God" (wind, lightning). They do **NOT** cover negligence.
If your tree was:
*   Obviously dead.
*   Rotting with visible **Hypoxylon Canker**.
*   Leaning dangerously for months.

...and you did nothing about it? If it falls, the insurance company might **deny your claim**, arguing that you failed to maintain your property. They might say the damage was preventable.

**This is why preventative trimming and deadwood removal is critical.** If you have a dead tree, you are sitting on a liability time bomb.

## What About Your Neighbor's Tree?
If your neighbor's tree falls on *your* house:
*   **You** file the claim with **your** insurance company.
*   Your insurance pays for the repairs.
*   Your insurance might go after the neighbor (subrogation) if they can prove the neighbor knew the tree was dead and ignored it.

## Steps to Take After Storm Damage
1.  **Safety First:** Stay away. Look for downed power lines (call Oncor immediately).
2.  **Mitigate Damage:** If the roof is punctured, you need to tarp it to prevent rain from ruining the interior. (We can help with emergency tarping).
3.  **Take Photos:** Document everything before we start cutting.
4.  **Call a Pro:** Do not let an uninsured "door knocker" on your roof.
