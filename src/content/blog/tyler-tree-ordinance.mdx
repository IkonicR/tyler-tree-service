# Can I Cut Down a Tree on My Property in Tyler?

This is the #1 question we get from homeowners in Smith County. The answer, as with most legal things, is: **It depends.**

The City of Tyler is known as "The Rose City," but it also takes pride in its urban canopy. The **Tyler Tree Preservation Ordinance** (Chapter 19 of the Code of Ordinances) protects certain trees from removal, especially during construction or commercial development.

However, for residential homeowners, the rules are often misunderstood.

## 1. What is a "Protected Tree"?

In Tyler, a tree is generally considered "Protected" if it meets certain size criteria (typically measured by Caliper inches at chest height) and is a desirable species (like Oaks, Pecans, and Elms).

If you live in a **Historic District** (like the Azalea District), the rules are much stricter. You almost always need a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) from the Historic Preservation Board before removing a visible tree.

## 2. The "Hazardous Tree" Exemption

Here is the good news for homeowners dealing with storm damage or dead trees: **Hazardous trees are typically exempt from preservation fees.**

If a tree is:
*   Dead or dying (verified by an arborist).
*   Structurally unstable (leaning dangerously).
*   Causing damage to a foundation or utility line.
*   Infected with a communicable disease (like **Pine Bark Beetles** or **Hypoxylon Canker**).

You generally have the right to remove it to protect your property.

**But there is a catch:** You should document the hazard *before* you cut it down.

## 3. How We Handle Compliance

We don't just cut trees; we protect you from fines.

When we assess a tree for removal, we check:
1.  **Is it in the Right-of-Way?** (Between sidewalk and street). If so, it's the City's tree/problem, or you need a permit.
2.  **Is it a Heritage Tree?** (Massive, healthy specimen).
3.  **Is it Hazardous?**

If the tree is hazardous, we note this in our quote. If the city ever questions why you removed that large Oak, our invoice serves as your proof that a professional deemed it a safety risk.

## 4. Construction & Development

If you are clearing a lot for a new home or pool, do **NOT** just start bulldozing. You need a Tree Preservation Plan filed with your building permit. Removing trees without this can stop your project and result in heavy fines per inch of tree removed.

## Summary

*   **Dead/Dangerous?** Usually okay to remove (Document it!).
*   **Historic District?** Permit required.
*   **New Construction?** Permit required.
*   **Right-of-Way?** City permission required.
