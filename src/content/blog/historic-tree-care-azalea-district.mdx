The **Azalea District** is the jewel of Tyler. The red brick streets, the 1930s architecture, and—most importantly—the massive, centenary trees create an atmosphere you can't find anywhere else in East Texas.

But owning a historic home with 100-year-old Water Oaks and Pecans presents unique challenges. These trees are seniors, and they need geriatric care.

## 1. The Challenge of "Brick Streets" and Roots
The charm of the brick streets is also a curse for tree roots.
*   **Soil Compaction:** Decades of traffic compress the soil, making it hard for roots to breathe.
*   **Root Pruning:** When the city repairs utilities under the street, they often cut major structural roots.
*   **Result:** We often see massive oaks that look healthy but have compromised root systems.

## 2. "Retrenchment" Pruning
You cannot prune a 100-year-old tree the same way you prune a 20-year-old one.
*   **The Goal:** We are not trying to stimulate rapid growth. We are trying to reduce weight to prevent failure.
*   **Technique:** We use "Retrenchment Pruning"—gradually reducing the canopy height over several years to mimic the tree's natural aging process. This reduces wind load without shocking the tree.

## 3. Cabling and Bracing
Many historic trees in Tyler have heavy, horizontal limbs that extend over roofs or sidewalks.
*   **Don't Cut It:** Instead of cutting a massive limb (which leaves a huge wound), we often install **Cobra Cables**.
*   **How It Works:** A high-strength cable connects the heavy limb to the central trunk. It acts as a safety belt, supporting the limb during high winds.

## 4. Soil De-Compaction (Air Spading)
This is the best thing you can do for an old tree.
*   **The Tool:** We use an "Air Spade" (compressed air) to blast apart the compacted soil around the roots without damaging the bark.
*   **The Fix:** We backfill with compost and biochar. It’s like giving the tree a breath of fresh air for the first time in 50 years.

## 5. Navigating the Historic Board
Remember, you usually cannot remove a tree in the Azalea District without approval.
*   We can write the **Arborist Reports** required by the Historic Preservation Board to prove if a tree is truly hazardous and needs removal.

**Preserve History.**
These trees were here before us, and with the right care, they will be here after us.
