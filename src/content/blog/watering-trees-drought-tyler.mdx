It’s August in Tyler. The temperature is 104°F, and it hasn't rained in three weeks. Your grass is brown, but your trees look... okay?

**Don't be fooled.**
Trees are masters of hiding stress until it's too late. By the time an Oak tree shows brown leaves from drought, the root damage is already severe. This stress is exactly what invites **Hypoxylon Canker** and **Borers** to move in and finish the job.

Here is how to keep your trees alive when the East Texas sky turns into a furnace.

## The Mistake: Sprinklers Aren't Enough
Running your lawn irrigation for 15 minutes keeps the grass green, but it does **nothing** for a tree.
*   Grass roots are 4 inches deep.
*   Tree roots are 12-24 inches deep.
*   Light sprinkling only wets the surface. The tree roots stay dry.

## The Solution: Deep Watering
You need to get water down deep where the feeder roots are.

### Method 1: The "Soaker Hose" Ring (Best)
1.  Buy a cheap soaker hose (the black kind that weeps water).
2.  Lay it in a spiral around the base of the tree. Start 2 feet from the trunk and spiral out to the "Drip Line" (the edge of the branches).
3.  Turn it on low for **2-4 hours**.
4.  Do this once every 2 weeks in summer.

### Method 2: The "Trickle" System
1.  Take your garden hose.
2.  Set it near the base of the tree (but not touching the trunk).
3.  Turn it on to a slow trickle (no spray).
4.  Let it run for 45 minutes.
5.  Move the hose to the other side of the tree and repeat.

## Which Trees Need It Most?
1.  **Young Trees (Planted in the last 2 years):** These are critical. Their roots haven't established yet. If they dry out once, they die. Water them *weekly*.
2.  **Post Oaks:** They are notoriously finicky. If you see them dropping leaves early, they are screaming for water.
3.  **Magnolias:** Large leaves lose water fast.

## The "Mulch" Factor
If you have bare dirt around your tree, the sun bakes the soil and evaporates the water instantly.
*   **Action:** Apply a 2-3 inch layer of native mulch around the base (but keep it off the trunk!). This acts like an insulator, keeping the soil cool and moist.

**Save the Tree, Save the Cost.**
Water is cheap. Removing a dead 60-foot Oak costs thousands. Deep watering is the best insurance policy you can buy.
