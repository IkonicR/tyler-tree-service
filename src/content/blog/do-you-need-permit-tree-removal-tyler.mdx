If you are a homeowner in **Tyler, TX**, you might be wondering if you can just fire up the chainsaw and remove that leaning Pine tree, or if you need permission from the City first.

The short answer? **It depends on where you live and where the tree is standing.**

While Texas generally defends property rights, the **City of Tyler** has specific ordinances (specifically **Chapter 19**) regarding tree preservation, especially in historic districts and public rights-of-way.

Here is everything you need to know to avoid fines and remove trees legally in Smith County.

## 1. The General Rule: Private Property
For the vast majority of homeowners in Tyler (outside of historic districts), **you do NOT need a permit** to remove a tree that is fully on your private property.

If you live in a standard subdivision like **The Woods**, **Hollytree**, or **Copeland**, and the tree is in your backyard:
*   You can remove it.
*   You can prune it.
*   You can grind the stump.

**The Exception:** If the tree is a "Heritage Tree" or "Protected Tree" designated by a specific development plan (rare for single-family homes, common for commercial developers), you might need to check your HOA rules. But as far as the *City* is concerned, it’s your tree.

## 2. The "Right-of-Way" Trap
This is where most Tyler homeowners get into trouble.

The **Right-of-Way (ROW)** is the strip of land between your sidewalk and the curb (or the first 10-15 feet from the street if there is no sidewalk).
*   **Who owns the tree?** technically, the City often controls this space.
*   **Who maintains it?** You do (usually).
*   **Can I cut it down?** **NO.**

If a tree is in the City Right-of-Way, you generally need permission from the **Tyler Urban Forestry Division** to remove it. If you cut down a street tree without a permit, you could face fines.

> **Pro Tip:** If a street tree is dying or hazardous, call the City of Tyler first. They may come out and remove it for free if it poses a risk to public safety (traffic/pedestrians).

## 3. The Azalea District & Historic Zones
If you live in the **Azalea Residential Historic District**, the rules are stricter. The historic charm of the brick streets and massive Oaks is protected by law.

*   **The Rule:** You cannot remove a "Protected Tree" (usually defined by diameter, often 10"+ DBH) without a Certificate of Appropriateness or a waiver.
*   **The Process:** You must submit a request to the Historic Preservation Board.
*   **Exceptions:** If the tree is dead, diseased (like **Hypoxylon Canker**), or an immediate hazard to the home, the process is expedited, but you still need that paper trail.

## 4. When DO You Need a Permit?
To summarize, you need to pick up the phone if:
1.  The tree is in the **Azalea District** or another Historic Overlay Zone.
2.  The tree is between the **sidewalk and the street**.
3.  You are clearing land for **new construction** (commercial or large residential developments require a Tree Preservation Plan).

## 5. What About Emergency Removal?
If a storm rolls through Smith County and a tree has fallen on your house, acts of God generally override the paperwork.
*   **Safety First:** Stabilize the situation.
*   **Document:** Take photos of the damage.
*   **Act:** Call an emergency tree service.

However, if the tree is just *leaning* and hasn't fallen yet, and it's in a protected zone, it’s best to get an Arborist's report (which we provide) stating the tree is a hazard. This usually guarantees permit approval.

## Summary
*   **Backyard in the suburbs?** Cut it down.
*   **Brick streets in Azalea?** Check with the City.
*   **Near the curb?** Check with the City.
