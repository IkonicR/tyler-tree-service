It’s 2:00 AM. A severe thunderstorm is hammering Smith County. You hear a loud *CRACK* followed by a shake that rattles your whole house.

A pine tree is on your roof. Rain is pouring into your living room.

**Panic sets in.** Who do you call? The fire department? The insurance agent? A tree guy?

Here is your game plan for a tree emergency in Tyler.

## 1. Assessing the Danger (Stop and Look)
Before you go outside, turn on the porch light and look through a window.
*   **Power Lines:** Is the tree touching a line? If yes, **stay inside** and call **Oncor** (1-888-313-4747). Do not let *anyone* near that tree until Oncor confirms the power is cut.
*   **Structure:** Is the house groaning? If the tree has crushed a load-bearing wall, evacuate the family to a neighbor's house or car.

## 2. Who to Call First?
*   **Life Safety:** If someone is trapped or there is a fire, call **911**.
*   **The Tree Service:** Call a dedicated **24/7 Emergency Tree Service** (like us at **903-282-4323**).
    *   *Why?* Regular landscapers don't answer the phone at 2 AM. And they definitely don't have the cranes and lighting towers needed to work in the dark and rain.

## 3. What Can Be Done at Night?
Realistically, we cannot fully remove a massive tree in the pitch black during a lightning storm. It’s too dangerous.
**The Night Phase is for Stabilization:**
1.  **Tarping:** We climb up and secure heavy-duty tarps over the holes to stop water damage.
2.  **Clearing Access:** We cut enough of the tree to unblock your driveway so you can get cars out or emergency vehicles in.
3.  **Support:** We might use ropes to stabilize the tree so it doesn't slide further.

The full removal usually happens at first light when it’s safer.

## 4. The Insurance Question
"Will insurance pay for the emergency call?"
**Almost always.** Insurance companies want to minimize damage. Paying us to tarp the roof tonight saves them paying for a ruined hardwood floor tomorrow.
*   **We take photos.** We document everything for your claim.
*   **Don't pay cash.** We can often bill the insurance portion directly or provide an invoice that gets reimbursed.

## 5. Why Price Should Not Be Your First Question
In an emergency, you are paying for **speed** and **risk**.
Removing a wet, slippery pine tree off a crushed roof at night is the most dangerous job in our industry.
*   **Cheap guys** will damage your roof further or get hurt (and sue you).
*   **Pros** use cranes to lift the tree *up* and off, causing zero additional damage.

**Save Our Number.**
You don't want to be Googling when the power is out.
